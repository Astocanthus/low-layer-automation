# Task Plans

This directory holds task and feature implementation plans used during development.

## Purpose

Plans capture the scope, steps, acceptance criteria, and verification story
for a piece of work before and during implementation.

## How Plans Are Created

- Generated by the `/epct` command (Explore, Plan, Code, Test workflow)
- Created manually when entering plan mode for non-trivial tasks
- Written by hand for standalone features or bugfixes

## Format

Plans follow the templates defined in `.claude/rules/todo.md` (plan template
and bugfix template). Each plan is named `<feature>-plan.md`.

## Git Status

Files in this directory are **gitignored** because they are local working
files tied to an active development session. They are not intended to be
shared or versioned.
